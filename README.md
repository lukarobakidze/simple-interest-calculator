# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple bash script to calculate simple interest.

## What does it do?
- Asks for three numbers: principal (amount), rate (percent), and time (years)
- Calculates the simple interest using the formula:
  
  `Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time / 100`
- Shows you the result in the terminal

## How to use
1. Open your terminal
2. Make sure you have `bc` installed (for calculations)
3. Run the script like this:
   ```bash
   ./simple-interest.sh 1000 5 2
   ```
   This example calculates interest for $1000 at 5% for 2 years.
